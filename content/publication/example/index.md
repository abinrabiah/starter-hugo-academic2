abstract: IoT devices often gather critical information that needs to be
  communicated in a secure manner. Authentication and secure communication in an
  IoT environment can be difficult because of constraints, in computing power,
  memory, energy and network connectivity. For secure communication with the
  rest of the network, an IoT device needs to trust the gateway through which it
  communicates, often over a wireless link. An IoT device needs a way of
  authenticating the gateway and vice-versa, to set up that secure channel. The
  protocol for authentication and key exchange needs to also work in situations
  where one or both parties lose connectivity with the outside of their network
  (eg, infrastructure failure, intermittent connectivity to the rest of the
  network, to save cost or power). We propose a lightweight authentication and
  key exchange protocol for IoT environments that is tailored to handle
  IoT-imposed constraints.
