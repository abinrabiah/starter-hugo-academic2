I am Ahmad Bin Rabiah, a master's of science student in Electrical and Computer Engieneering at Purdue University. I am interseted in teaching machines to solve visual problems with inlabeled cases and results a creative understanding of the real world to emerge. I am also itereseted in machine learning, understanding visuals with another domain such as voice, and interaction as they relate to this. 

Prviously, I have worked on signal processing and wireless communication systems in an applied advanced research lab in Saudi Arabia. Before that, I graduated from King Saud University with a BS in electrical engineering minor in communication systems with a focus on signal processing, where I was lucky to be worked and published my first research work advised by Omar Aldayel And Saleh AlShebeili.
